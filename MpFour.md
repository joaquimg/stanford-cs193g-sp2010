# Machine Problem Four #

In MP4, we'll revisit two problems from earlier MPs using Thrust, a productivity library for CUDA. With Thrust, we'll rebuild our binning and Black-Scholes programs using generic parallel primitives.

The fourth MP consists of two parts. You can get all the files you'll need by doing an svn checkout from our source tree as follows:

```
svn checkout http://stanford-cs193g-sp2010.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/assignments/mp4 mp4
```
